# IVPackHandlingOverhaul
Reworking the vehicles to have their own handling behavior, also more realistic. No full realism, feel over numbers.

DISCLAIMER - This mod is built upon _CP_'s .meta files, and therebefore its not a full work of mine. The original .metas are from CP and Carrythxd.

# How to install
Just drop the 'common' folder inside the /pres/ DLCPack, where IVPack's vehicle meta files are. You'll replace handling.meta and vehicles.meta this way.

Then fire up the game.
